To send a text message such as "YOUR CHILD HAS BOARDED A BUS" from your texts app, you can use a third-party SMS service like Twilio or any other SMS gateway. I'll guide you through the process using Twilio, which is widely used and has straightforward integration with Django.

Step 1: Install Twilio
First, install the Twilio Python package if you haven't done so already:

bash
Copy code
pip install twilio
Step 2: Set Up Twilio Account
Sign up for a Twilio account: Go to Twilio's website and sign up for an account.
Get your credentials:
Account SID: Found in your Twilio dashboard.
Auth Token: Found in your Twilio dashboard.
Twilio Phone Number: You'll get this after setting up your Twilio account.
Step 3: Store Twilio Credentials in Django Settings
Add your Twilio credentials to your settings.py file to keep them secure and manageable:

python
Copy code
# settings.py

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid_here'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token_here'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number_here'
Step 4: Create a Function to Send SMS in views.py
In the views.py file of your texts app, create a function that sends the SMS using Twilio.

nfc/texts/views.py:

python
Copy code
from django.conf import settings
from twilio.rest import Client
from django.http import HttpResponse

def send_bus_boarding_sms(request, parent_phone_number):
    # Initialize Twilio client
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, settings.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    
    # Define the message content
    message_body = "YOUR CHILD HAS BOARDED A BUS"
    
    # Send the SMS
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message_body,
        from_=settings.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=parent_phone_number
    )
    
    return HttpResponse(f"Message sent to {parent_phone_number} with SID {message.sid}")
Step 5: Define a URL for Sending the SMS
You need a URL route to trigger the SMS. Update your urls.py to handle this.

nfc/texts/urls.py:

python
Copy code
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('send-sms/<str:parent_phone_number>/', views.send_bus_boarding_sms, name='send_bus_boarding_sms'),
]
Step 6: Include the texts URLs in the Main URL Configuration
In your main urls.py file (e.g., rest/urls.py), ensure that the URLs from the texts app are included:

python
Copy code
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('texts/', include('nfc.texts.urls')),  # Include texts URLs
]
Step 7: Test the SMS Functionality
Now, with everything set up, you can test sending the SMS. Run your Django server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Then visit the URL in your browser or use tools like Postman to trigger the SMS functionality:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8000/texts/send-sms/<parent_phone_number>/
Replace <parent_phone_number> with the actual phone number of the parent you want to send the SMS to, in the format +1234567890 (make sure to include the country code).

Example:
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8000/texts/send-sms/+1234567890/
This will send the text message "YOUR CHILD HAS BOARDED A BUS" to the specified phone number.

Step 8: (Optional) Handle Multiple Notifications
If you're sending multiple SMS notifications (like boarding, arriving at school, etc.), you can extend the function to send different messages based on the event.

For example:

python
Copy code
def send_sms(request, parent_phone_number, event_type):
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, settings.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    
    if event_type == 'boarding':
        message_body = "YOUR CHILD HAS BOARDED A BUS"
    elif event_type == 'arrival':
        message_body = "YOUR CHILD HAS ARRIVED AT SCHOOL"
    else:
        message_body = "YOUR CHILD HAS LEFT SCHOOL"
    
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message_body,
        from_=settings.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=parent_phone_number
    )
    
    return HttpResponse(f"Message sent to {parent_phone_number} with SID {message.sid}")
Update the URL to:

python
Copy code
path('send-sms/<str:parent_phone_number>/<str:event_type>/', views.send_sms, name='send_sms'),
Now you can send different types of messages based on the event.

Conclusion
With these steps, you can now send SMS notifications to parents from the texts app when a child boards the bus. Using Twilio in combination with Django makes it easy to automate and send SMS messages from your application.
